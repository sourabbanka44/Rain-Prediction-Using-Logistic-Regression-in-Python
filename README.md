# Rain-Prediction-Using-Logistic-Regression-in-Python
Rain Prediction Using Logistic Regression implemented in Python using sklearn.

This repository builts a logistic regression model to predict rainfall based on a random rainfall dataset.

Following are the parameters which are considered for the prediction:
MinTemp,MaxTemp,Rainfall,WindSpeed,Humidity,Pressure,Cloud,RainToday,RainTomorrow

The Inputs are taken by the user based on the present weather conditions in a very simple and basic GUI created using Tkinter in python and results are also displayed in the GUI in the lower frame.

You can find some illustrations of how the input and output looks like in the Outputs folder ,there are some screenshots for reference.
